# Temperature Evolution Visualization Project

This repository contains the code for my completion of the Functional Programming in Scala Capstone project on Coursera. The project focuses on building a large data-intensive application that visualizes the evolution of temperatures over time all over the world.

## Project Overview

The project involves the implementation of a complete application that processes several gigabytes of data from weather stations. The main objectives include:

- Transforming raw data into meaningful information, such as the average temperature of each point of the globe over the last ten years.
- Generating visualizations using spatial and linear interpolation techniques.
- Implementing user interface interactions to enable users to explore temperature data dynamically.

## Features

- Data transformation: Process weather station data to calculate average temperatures.
- Visualization: Generate interactive visualizations showing the evolution of temperatures over time globally.
- User interface: Implement features allowing users to explore temperature data and interact with the visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- Scala programming language
- Functional programming concepts
- Data processing and manipulation techniques
- Spatial and linear interpolation algorithms
- User interface development tools
